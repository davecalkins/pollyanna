Simple pollyanna gift exchange app.  Plug in the names and it comes up
with a random drawing of who gets who.

For each person a name and family name is specified.  The code ensures
that noone gets someone in their same family, that 1 family doesn't
entirely get another family, and optionally that previous year's picks
aren't used (see pollyanna.prevpicks.txt).
